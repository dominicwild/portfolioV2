A basic project that was developed for fun entirely through Java. The Snooker game was used as a way to practice object 
orientated design and tackle the challenges associated with building a game (such as dealing with frames and game logic).

The conclusion of this project is a fully implemented game of Snooker, tested for following all the rules correctly.
