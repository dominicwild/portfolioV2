I made this site completely from scratch, only using Bootstrap. I took this opportunity to make the site in a mobile first 
manner, making it completely responsive was a goal of this project.

With this project I also put to use some lessons I learned in my prior social network project. Some key aspects I explored in 
this project were: Use of PHP for templating repetitive page elements, using Google fonts, using CSS animations, responsive 
design and content management.

One design decision I made on this site was not to use a database. As this seemed overkill for a static website 
(no complex data or data relationships), at least at the scale it is now. Being much easier to manage with PHP arrays that 
dynamically create content, essentially a database as PHP arrays instead.

This website will continue to grow over time as more projects get developed. At the moment the layout is fairly simple and I 
plan to evolve it into something more visually appealing in the future as a passion project. Some usability improvements are 
also planned.
