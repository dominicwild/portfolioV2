A distributed fault tolerant auction system made with Java. Featured a dynamic replication server, authentication mechanism, 
encrypted data transmission, 5 step challenge response protocol.

The project made strong use of Java RMI (remote method invocation) for communication between clients and servers. There were 
distributed auction servers that had to keep up-to-date with the system as a whole to function correctly. JGroups was used as
a group server communication protocol library to ensure atomic interactions, guarantee packet arrival, manage dead connections
 etc.

The project concluded with a robust and simple distributed auction system, giving me lots of experience in the challenges
associated with design, architecture and programming distributed systems.
