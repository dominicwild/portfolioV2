A Natural Language Processing project using machine learning techniques to identify the language of a particular corpus of text.

The classifier was made completely from scratch using Java, with no external machine learning libraries used. 
Cross validation, frequency analysis and variable training set size methods were used to evaluate the effectiveness of the 
technique implemented.

My language identification system works on using rank-order n-gram statistics to predict a language. The output of my system 
is a distance metric that determines how likely a piece of text is to be a particular target language. Implementation was based
off of a research paper.

Building this system taught me a lot about machine learning and the processes that need to be undertaken in order to process
 data. It gave me experience of processing high volumes of data (300k sentences) and analysing that data to form conclusions.

The conclusion of this project was an accurate classifier, maintaining 95% accuracy even for corpus only 20-40 words in size,
needing 30,000-40,000 words to give stable predictions. This was all validated using 10 fold cross validation (tested only 
with English, Czech, German and Solvenian).
