A game developed through the Java's JSFML library. This game was developed alongside some friends of mine. Art was made by a 
friend and majority of the coding was done by me.

The experience taught me a lot about the importance and effectiveness of object orientated design. Before development I made a 
UML diagram to plan out the object design, with inheritance and along with how the code would flow, what particular classes and 
objects should generally do, how the engine would work, any extra challenges we may face.

The parts of the game I coded were:

- The Game Engine
- 4 Coordinated Enemy AI Types
- Car Modification System (swap different tyres, weapons (primary and secondary weapons), armour, car skins)
- Physics Engine
- Rendering Engine
- The Game's HUD
- Two Game Modes (Hoard and Survival Mode)

Working within a group also meant it was important to keep code well documented and commented. I therefore kept all code 
commented and up to date. I scheduled regular communication and meetings to ensure we were making steady progress, catching 
problems early.

The result was a game with a refined twin stick combat system. The game does however lack content to consider it a full fledged 
game, however the baseline exists for this game to be developed into something official.
