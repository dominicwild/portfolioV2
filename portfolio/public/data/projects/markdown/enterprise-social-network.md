This project was undertaken as part of my university placement. It involved developing a social networking site through the 
full software development life cycle (Analyis, design, implementation, testing and evaluation). The company was facing some 
internal social communication problems, no knew what events were happening or what their co-workers were up to. Initial 
need-finding took place via interviews and a company wide questionnaire, data quantized, analyzed and requirements were derived,
among a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) plan.

The requirements were designed and then implemented successfully, meeting the MVP. The project later went on to form part of 
my dissertation designing an incremental development technique for Enterprise Social Networks. The ESN was made with CakePHP,
which sped up development and taught me a lot about web development, the general architecture and approaches most common
frameworks employ to streamline development.

During the testing phase, the company was unable to deploy my solution on their services in good time. Therefore over a 
weekend I decided to move my solution to Amazon AWS. This was my first time deploying a web server on a linux distribution,
it involved lots of rapid learning and was a very fun experience. The knowledge I gained from this experience was invaluable,
as I'm utilizing it right now, to write and host this portfolio website!

The finished product was feature complete containing the following features:

- OAuth2 Google authentication
- User Posts and Comments
- Image Attachments for Posts
- User Created Polls
- Recent Activity Panel
- Event System (for organising social events)
- Group System (for categorizing events and posts)
- Google Calendar Integration (for events)
- Administration Page
- HTML Email Notifications for various alerts (new events, comments, posts etc)
- User Profiles
