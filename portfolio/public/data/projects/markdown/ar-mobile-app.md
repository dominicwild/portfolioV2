This was a group project named HEART (Historical Experiences in Augmented Reality). The application was developed in Unity 
(using C#) using a library called Vuforia which specializes in the development of AR applications.

HEART's goal was to digitally reconstruct old heritage sites and provide a innovative approach to delivering information about 
such a site. We developed a prototype, not having the technical expertise or resources to achieve the full product.

My responsibilities in this project were coding parts of the application, such as scripts to play media, progress bar & its 
trigger, researching voice controls etc. I also designed an experiment to test the usability of the application following a 
validated scale for measuring usability, which I adapated specifically for the experiment. I gather participants, explained 
the procedure and statistically analysed the results.

Meeting deadlines within this project was of critical importance, therefore I made and managed a Slack to keep track of 
everyone's work. I integrated this will Google Doc notifications to ensure the team was always aware of when new files were 
added to our shared resources. The project demonstrated the importance of keeping active communication with a team to ensure 
a project is on track and help team members with any bumps along the way. Along with asking for help from people on the team 
with more Unity experience than me, they were a valuable source of learning.

The conclusion of the project was a proof of concept AR application with voice assistant, hot spots, voice controls, audio 
and video logs, animated historical scenes etc. that highlighted the future challenges such an application would face.
